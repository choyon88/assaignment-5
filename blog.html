        <div class="font-inner font-bold text-2xl my-5">Question: What is event bubble</div>

        <p>
            Event bubbling is a phenomenon in the Document Object Model (DOM) where events that occur on a child element are propagated up the DOM tree to its parent elements.
            When an event is triggered on an element, such as a click event, the event is first captured by the innermost child element and then it "bubbles up" the DOM tree, triggering any event listeners that may be attached to its parent elements. This means that if an element has event listeners attached to it and its parent elements, all of those listeners will be triggered when an event occurs on the child element.

        <div class="font-inner font-bold text-2xl my-5">Question: What is callback function and its purpose</div>
<p> A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when that function completes. The purpose of a callback function in JavaScript is to allow asynchronous operations, where a function can continue executing while waiting for a long-running operation to complete.</p>
